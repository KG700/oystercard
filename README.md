## Oystercard project. 

### Step 1
Setup project directory, create GitHub repo and link project directory/git/github.
This part is fairly familliar now so I have done it with minimal trouble/assistance although did need Kate to help with "git clone" vs "git remote add origin ...SSH code thing..."

Done

### Step 2
Create GemFile &c

run "gem list"
check if 'bundler' is there
run bundle init - creates empty gemfile ready for me to add info to.
 - added info as per Kate's research (while I was away) should research this a little myself.\
 run "bundle"
 - adds gemfile.lock to project dir.

 Done

 ### Step 3
Create file that has the spec naming convention (in the spec file etc.)
prepare first rspec test
run code to pass this test
